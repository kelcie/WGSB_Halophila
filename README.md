Abstract:
It is hypothesized that climate change can facilitate the invasion of exotic species into degraded habitats. 
However, species interactions and environmental conditions can limit a species’ potential to become invasive. 
Thus, environmental changes may be linked to phenotypic plasticity and invasive traits. 
This is because the genes that control these traits can be modified depending on the organism’s environment. 
This research tests the hypothesis of whether species interactions in a novel environment induce epigenetic signatures of seagrass invasion. 
To investigate this, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment of invasive Halophila stipulacea mixed with native Syringodium filiforme 
seagrasses to assess how species interactions affects their local acclimation and adaptation along a nutrient gradient. 
Seagrass cores were extracted from mixed seagrass communities and transplanted into areas with bare sand devoid of seagrasses. 
Preliminary transplant experiments indicate that the invasive seagrass outperforms the native seagrass, and its growth was not significantly 
different between both sites. However, our results reveal phenotypic variation in response to competition and acclimation to a novel environment. 
We found changes of vegetative traits in the invasive seagrass, in which it invested less in vegetative height, but more in internode length and vegetative shoots, 
indicating a guerilla growth strategy. The opposite occurred for the native seagrass, in which growth declined in the presence of the invasive, 
but overall performance was better in ambient conditions (i.e., not reciprocally transplanted). We then tested the role of how species interactions 
induce an epigenetic signature that may promote an invasive phenotype. We performed WGBS on Halophila stipulacea grown in monoculture at Tamarindo Grande, and from transplant experiment,
where samples grew with native Syringodium filiforme in Tamarindo Grande, Halophila samples that grew with Syringodium filiforme in Punta Melones, and the transplant where they 
grew with Syringodium filiforme but was transplanted from Tamarindo Grande to Punta Melones, where we found the most phenotypic variation in vegetative traits.
